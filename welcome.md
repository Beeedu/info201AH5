# Climate Change Status by Nation
## Project: Emerald gate

 - **Problem Situation**: Our group is focusing on a global environmental issue, and it involves physical, social, and cultural sites. Some countries might not have the stability or the resources to commit to cleaner forms of energy, and comparing countries based solely off of energy would be blind to these other factors, and thus a potentially unfair representation of those countries. People viewing this data could lead to the formation of opinions of countries based on their energy data and could affect the lives of people in those countries by having their reputation changed. Under our problem situation, there could be many direct and indirect stakeholders. For example, the policy-makers of countries could be the direct stakeholder and citizens are the indirect stakeholders. Our team wants to create a new website to present direct visualization-based data to the audience and evoke the action of environmental protection.

 - **What is the problem?**: Climate change has been an increasingly imminent issue over time. All over the world, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, the weather is becoming more extreme, floods and droughts are more common, and more. All of these changes are a consequence of the Earth's global average temperature increasing, which is due to our rapidly changing atmosphere. To reverse this change in the atmosphere, drastic changes in nations' carbon emissions must take place.

 - **Why does it matter?**: We all live on this planet, and the changes in the Earth's climate has ramifications on the world as a whole. Rising sea levels endanger countries' coastlines, increased carbon levels in the atmosphere also affects marine life and food availability, and with how connected the world is, a crisis in one country will have ramifications on many locations.

 - **How will it be addressed?**: We will compare countries based on their change over time of the types of energy they are using and by their total emissions per capita. This will shed some light on whether certain countries have been improving or regressing over time with regard to their effect on climate change.

**Research questions**
 - Question 1: What are the rankings of countries by the most decrease in emissions per capita over time?
 - Question 2: What are the rankings of countries by the emissions per capita in a particular year?
